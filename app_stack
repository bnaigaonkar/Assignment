In terms of java, we need to remove unwanted data ie replication data,
serialization of sessions objects,
improvemnet in project in terms of failure
testing applcation regressivly 
Error handling at module level
so that app will be working great and high avilable of any time if it is dependancy of
server then I will be recommend to use aws to manage load balancing and high 
availablity of apps.
